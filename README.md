# Ambient Concept Generator

A browser-based inspiration tool for ambient musicians. Combines modifiers and nouns across moods and settings to generate evocative two or three word concepts as starting points for new pieces.

## What It Does

Opens with a concept already loaded. Hit Generate to get another. Optionally filter by Mood and Setting to bias the results toward what you're already feeling — or leave both unselected for pure surprise.

**Mood** (optional): Dark · Light

**Setting** (optional): Space · Nature · Urban · Signal · Fictional

Combinations work independently — Dark + Space gives you something different from Dark + Nature or just Dark alone. Previous concepts appear at the bottom as clickable chips.

No accounts, no API, no cost. Works offline after fonts load.

## Background

Made by [Soap Box Rocket](https://soapboxrocket.bandcamp.com) — a Seattle-based ambient project working primarily on the Dirtywave M8 and Deluge. The tool came out of wanting a creative starting point that gets out of the way fast — one strong concept is enough to anchor a whole piece.

Inspired by tracks like [Number Station](https://soapboxrocket.bandcamp.com/track/number-station) — built around a captured shortwave broadcast — and [Maui Tuesday](https://soapboxrocket.bandcamp.com/track/maui-tuesday), recorded while sitting on a beach trying to match a synth to the real sound in front of me. The best pieces start with a real-world anchor. This tool helps find one.
